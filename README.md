# Relative_Space
Top 2-D scrolling game with time manipulation mechanics.

The player starts in the middle of the screen and must avoid incoming obstacles with the arrow keys while collecting gates descending across the screen.
As a player gets closer to the larger obstacles (referred to as GravityObstacles), the speed of the game (obstacle velocities and spawn rates) are slowed based off the distance between the player and said obstacle.
The speed change is based off the inverse of general relativity's time dilation.
