# Relative_Space
Top scrolling game with game speed manipulation.

The player starts in the middle of the screen and must avoid incoming obstacles with the arrow keys and collecting gates along the way. As a player gets closer to the larger obstacles (referred to as GravityObstacles), the speed of the game (obstacle velocities and spawn rates) are slowed based off the distance between the player and said obstacle. It is based off the inverse of general relativities time dilations.
